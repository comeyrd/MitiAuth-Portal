# MitiAuth-Portal

An Archived Old web-project

---------

A base portal using AccessControl with base authentification, user data management. 
The goal is to have a base website with authentication, basic administration and access control depending on the type of users. When finished, could be used as base to create any web project.

This project is a long term project, where i try to make a library for my future projects, so when i have a simple web app i want to create and build, i can have user authentication, user administration simply by forking this repository and adapting the User Layout for the web app.

I started working on this project a long time ago and i work on it when i have some spare time.

It previously had a "test" website where you could see what the portal looked like, but i have shut it down until i have a version i am proud of.
